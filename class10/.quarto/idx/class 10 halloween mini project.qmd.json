Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?\n\nThe winpercent is on a 0-100 scale and the rest are 0-1. \n\n\n> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?\n\nzero means it doesn't contain any chocolate and one means that chocolate is present \n\n> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot (candy) + \n  aes(x=winpercent) +\n  geom_histogram(bins= 20)\n```\n\n\n> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?\n\n```{r}\nggplot (candy) + \n  aes(x=winpercent) +\n  geom_density()\n```\nThe distribution is not symmetrical as it is slightly skewed to the right. \n\n\n> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?\n\n```{r}\nsummary(candy$winpercent)\n```\n\nThe center of the distribution is below 50%, it is observed to peak around 40% due to a median of 47.83%. \n\n> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?\n\nfor chocolate: \n\n```{r}\n# 1. Find all chocolate candy in the dataset\n\nchoc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1\n# 2.

Is this difference statistically significant?\n\n```{r}\nt.test(choc.win, fruit.win)\n```\nThe difference is statisically significant due to a low p value of 2.817e-08. \n\n## Overall Candy Rankings \n\n> Q13.

This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?\n\n```{r}\nggplot (candy) + \n  aes( x=winpercent, \n       y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) + \n  geom_col()\n```\n\nAdd some color based on the \"type of candy\" \n\n```{r}\nmy_cols <- rep(\"black\", nrow(candy))\n\nmy_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = \"chocolate\"\nmy_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = \"brown\"\nmy_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = \"pink\"\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nggplot(candy) + \n  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +\n  geom_col(fill=my_cols) \n```\n\n\n\n\n> Q17.
