This week we are looking at differential expression analysis. 

The data for this hands-on session comes from a publiched RNA seq- experiment where airway smooth muscle cells were treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid steroid with anti-inflammatory effects (Himes et al. 2014) 


## Import/Read the daya from Himes et al. 

```{r}
library(BiocManager)
library(DESeq2)
```

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names=1 )
head(counts)
```

```{r}
metadata <-  read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
head(metadata)
```

> Q1. How many genes are in this dataset? 

There are `r nrow(counts)` genes in this data set 

> Q2. How many ‘control’ cell lines do we have?

```{r}
n.control <- sum(metadata$dex == "control")
```
There are `r n.control` control cell lines
